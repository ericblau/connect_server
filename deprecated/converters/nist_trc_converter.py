# This is the converter for the NIST TRC repository.
# Arguments:
#   input_path (string): The file or directory where the data resides.
#       NOTE: Do not hard-code the path to the data in the converter (the filename can be hard-coded, though). The converter should be portable.
#   metadata (string or dict): The path to the JSON dataset metadata file, a dict or json.dumps string containing the dataset metadata, or None to specify the metadata here. Default None.
#   verbose (bool): Should the script print status messages to standard output? Default False.
#       NOTE: The converter should have NO output if verbose is False, unless there is an error.
